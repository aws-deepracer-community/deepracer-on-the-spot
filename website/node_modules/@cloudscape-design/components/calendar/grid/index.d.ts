/**
 * Calendar grid supports two mechanisms of keyboard navigation:
 * - Native screen-reader table navigation (semantic table markup);
 * - Keyboard arrow-keys navigation (a custom key-down handler).
 *
 * The implementation largely follows the w3 example (https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/dialog-modal/datepicker-dialog) and shares the following issues:
 * - (table navigation) Chrome+VO - weekday is announced twice when navigating to the calendar's header;
 * - (table navigation) Safari+VO - "dimmed" state is announced twice;
 * - (table navigation) Firefox/Chrome+NVDA - cannot use table navigation if any cell has a focus;
 * - (keyboard navigation) Firefox+NVDA - every date is announced as "not selected";
 * - (keyboard navigation) Safari/Chrome+VO - weekdays are not announced;
 * - (keyboard navigation) Safari/Chrome+VO - dates are not announced as interactive (clickable or selectable);
 * - (keyboard navigation) Safari/Chrome+VO - date announcements are not interruptive and can be missed if navigating fast.
